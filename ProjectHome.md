GeneHuggers is an open source, Qt/C++ library of classes for use in the construction of Bioinformatics programs. Various aspects of routine programming are encapsulated in these classes to aid in the rapid development of applications and remove redundant programming tasks. The library supports the development of both CLI and GUI programs and aims to make all program functions independent of the user interface (or lack thereof).
