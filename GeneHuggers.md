# Introduction #

GeneHuggers is a library of classes and functions to aid bioinformaticians in the creation of applications that can be controlled through a GUI. The main underlying philosophy behind GeneHuggers is that most all programs should be capable of running either with or without a GUI so GeneHuggers aims to place all the 'boilerplate' code required to make an application function in either environment in the library so that the developer can focus on what the program is trying to do rather that the implementation of interface logic.
